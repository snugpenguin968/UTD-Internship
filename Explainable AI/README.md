This took up the bulk of the internship. My main job was to test Kaggle or UCI ML datasets on the FOLD-R++ (binary classification) and FOLD-RM (multiclass classification) algorithms. These algorithms unlock the "black box" behind ML decisions with Prolog rules which I included in each folder. I am also creating data science pipeline for each dataset to see how my custom models stack up in different situations.
